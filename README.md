# Loading and Processing Transcripts from a file

Code to build a small package to handle the loading and processing of a transcripts file. The ultimate goal is to provide a pretty slide-out panel to quickly scan and read the full transcript for a given lesson. When you click any relevant sentence, it will take you to the exact portion of the video where that line is spoken.
